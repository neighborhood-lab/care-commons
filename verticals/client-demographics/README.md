## Data Model

### Client Entity

```typescript
interface Client {
  // Identity
  id: UUID;
  organizationId: UUID;
  branchId: UUID;
  clientNumber: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  dateOfBirth: Date;
  
  // Contact
  primaryPhone?: Phone;
  email?: string;
  primaryAddress: Address;
  
  // Healthcare
  primaryPhysician?: HealthcareProvider;

- `SAFETY_CONCERN` - General safety concern
- `ABUSE_NEGLECT_CONCERN` - Suspected abuse or neglect
- `OTHER` - Other documented risk

## Usage

### Creating a Client

```typescript
import { ClientService, CreateClientInput } from '@care-commons/client-demographics';
import { UserContext } from '@care-commons/core';

const clientService = new ClientService(clientRepository);

const input: CreateClientInput = {
  organizationId: 'org-uuid',
  branchId: 'branch-uuid',
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  dateOfBirth: new Date('1945-03-15'),
  primaryAddress: {
    type: 'HOME',
    line1: '123 Main St',
    city: 'Springfield',
    state: 'IL',
    postalCode: '62701',
    country: 'US',
  },
  emergencyContacts: [
    {
      name: 'John Smith',
      relationship: 'Son',
      phone: { number: '555-0100', type: 'MOBILE', canReceiveSMS: true },
      isPrimary: true,
      canMakeHealthcareDecisions: true,
    },
  ],
  status: 'PENDING_INTAKE',
};

const context: UserContext = {
  userId: 'user-uuid',
  roles: ['COORDINATOR'],
  permissions: ['clients:create'],
  organizationId: 'org-uuid',
  branchIds: ['branch-uuid'],
};

const client = await clientService.createClient(input, context);
```

### Searching Clients

```typescript
const results = await clientService.searchClients(
  {
    query: 'Smith',
    status: ['ACTIVE', 'PENDING_INTAKE'],
    branchId: 'branch-uuid',
  },
  { page: 1, limit: 20 },
  context
);

console.log(`Found ${results.total} clients`);
results.items.forEach(client => {
  console.log(`${client.firstName} ${client.lastName} - ${client.status}`);
});
```

### Managing Emergency Contacts

```typescript
// Add emergency contact
await clientService.addEmergencyContact(
  clientId,
  {
    name: 'Mary Smith',
    relationship: 'Daughter',
    phone: { number: '555-0200', type: 'MOBILE', canReceiveSMS: true },
    isPrimary: false,
    canMakeHealthcareDecisions: true,
  },
  context
);

// Remove emergency contact
await clientService.removeEmergencyContact(clientId, contactId, context);
```

### Managing Risk Flags

```typescript
// Add risk flag
await clientService.addRiskFlag(
  clientId,
  {
    type: 'FALL_RISK',
    severity: 'HIGH',
    description: 'Client has history of falls, uses walker',
    mitigationPlan: 'Non-slip mats installed, walker required for all ambulation',
    requiresAcknowledgment: true,
  },
  context
);

// Resolve risk flag
await clientService.resolveRiskFlag(clientId, flagId, context);
```

### Updating Client Status

```typescript
// Discharge client
await clientService.updateClientStatus(
  clientId,
  'DISCHARGED',
  'Moved to assisted living facility',
  context
);
```
