# Scheduling & Visit Management - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The **Scheduling & Visit Management** vertical has been successfully implemented as a foundational component of the Folk platform. This vertical provides comprehensive functionality for planning, coordinating, and tracking care visits in home-based care organizations.

## What Was Built

### Core Components

1. **Type Definitions** (`src/types/schedule.ts`)
   - 25+ TypeScript interfaces covering the full domain model
   - Service patterns for recurring care schedules
   - Visit lifecycle with 15 distinct statuses
   - Recurrence rules supporting daily, weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly patterns
   - Assignment methods and verification data for EVV compliance
   - Exception tracking and calendar view settings

2. **Validation Layer** (`src/validation/schedule-validator.ts`)
   - Runtime validation using Zod schemas
   - Input validation for all create/update operations
   - Business rule validation (time windows, date ranges, constraints)
   - Type-safe validation with automatic TypeScript inference

3. **Repository Layer** (`src/repository/schedule-repository.ts`)
   - PostgreSQL data access with type-safe queries
   - CRUD operations for patterns, schedules, and visits
   - Complex search with multiple filter combinations
   - Visit number generation
   - Efficient indexing strategy for common queries
   - Soft delete support

4. **Service Layer** (`src/service/schedule-service.ts`)
   - Business logic for scheduling operations
   - Pattern-to-visit generation with recurrence calculation
   - Caregiver assignment logic with availability checking
   - Visit lifecycle state machine with validated transitions
   - Conflict detection for client and caregiver schedules
   - Authorization limit enforcement
   - Role-based permission checking

5. **Database Migration** (`packages/core/migrations/003_scheduling_visits.sql`)
   - Complete schema for 4 tables:
     - `service_patterns` - Recurring care templates
     - `schedules` - Generated visit schedules
     - `visits` - Individual visit occurrences
     - `visit_exceptions` - Exception tracking
   - 30+ indexes for query optimization
   - Constraints and triggers for data integrity
   - Full-text search capabilities

## Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns

1. **Layered Architecture**
   - Clear separation: Types → Validation → Repository → Service
   - Each layer has single responsibility
   - Testable at each level

2. **State Machine**
   - Visit status follows strict state machine rules
   - Invalid transitions rejected at runtime
   - Complete audit trail of all transitions

3. **Event Sourcing (Lite)**
   - Status history is append-only
   - Complete reconstruction of visit timeline
   - Never loses historical data

4. **JSONB for Flexibility**
   - Recurrence rules as JSONB
   - Status history as JSONB array
   - Address and verification data as JSONB
   - Fast queries with GIN indexes

5. **Soft Deletes**
   - All entities support soft delete
   - Historical data preserved
   - Audit compliance

### Data Model

```
ServicePattern (1) ──generates──> (*) Visit
                                       ↓
                                 assigns to
                                       ↓
                                 (1) Caregiver
                                       ↓
                                 has many
                                       ↓
                                 (*) VisitException
```

### Permission Model

- Organization-scoped access
- Branch-level filtering for limited roles
- Permission checks at service layer
- Role-based status update authorization
- Caregiver can only update own assigned visits

## Integration Points

- ✅ **Core Package** - Base types, permissions, audit
- 🔄 **Client & Demographics** - Client addresses and information (structure ready)
- 🔄 **Caregiver & Staff** - Caregiver availability and skills (structure ready)
- 📋 **Care Plans & Tasks** - Task templates (structure ready)
- 📋 **Time Tracking & EVV** - Actual time tracking (structure ready)
- 📋 **Billing & Invoicing** - Billable hours (structure ready)

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Create a pattern for weekday morning care
const pattern = await scheduleService.createServicePattern({
  organizationId: 'org-123',
  branchId: 'branch-456',
  clientId: 'client-789',
  name: 'Daily Morning Personal Care',
  patternType: 'RECURRING',
  serviceTypeId: 'service-type-001',
  serviceTypeName: 'Personal Care',
  recurrence: {
    frequency: 'WEEKLY',
    interval: 1,
    daysOfWeek: ['MONDAY', 'TUESDAY', 'WEDNESDAY', 'THURSDAY', 'FRIDAY'],
    startTime: '08:00',
    timezone: 'America/New_York',
  },
  duration: 120,
  requiredCertifications: ['HHA', 'CPR'],
  effectiveFrom: new Date('2024-01-01'),
  effectiveTo: new Date('2024-12-31'),
}, userContext);

// Generate 4 weeks of visits
const visits = await scheduleService.generateScheduleFromPattern({
  patternId: pattern.id,
  startDate: new Date('2024-01-01'),
  endDate: new Date('2024-01-28'),
  autoAssign: false,
  respectHourlyLimits: true,
}, userContext);

// Assign a caregiver
await scheduleService.assignCaregiver({
  visitId: visits[0].id,
  caregiverId: 'caregiver-xyz',
  assignmentMethod: 'MANUAL',
}, userContext);

// Track visit lifecycle
await scheduleService.updateVisitStatus({
  visitId: visits[0].id,
  newStatus: 'CONFIRMED',
}, userContext);

await scheduleService.updateVisitStatus({
  visitId: visits[0].id,
  newStatus: 'IN_PROGRESS',
  locationVerification: {
    method: 'GPS',
    timestamp: new Date(),
    latitude: 40.7128,
    longitude: -74.0060,
    accuracy: 10,
    isWithinGeofence: true,
  },
}, userContext);

// Complete the visit
await scheduleService.completeVisit({
  visitId: visits[0].id,
  actualEndTime: new Date(),
  completionNotes: 'All tasks completed.',
  tasksCompleted: 5,
  tasksTotal: 5,
  locationVerification: { /* ... */ },
}, userContext);
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Partial indexes on soft-deleted records
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- GIN indexes for JSONB and full-text search
- Efficient pagination with LIMIT/OFFSET

### Query Patterns
- Minimal JOINs (denormalized data)
- Filtered indexes for hot queries (unassigned visits)
- Status-based partial indexes
- Date range optimization

### Scalability
- Pattern-based generation prevents data explosion
- Soft deletes maintain referential integrity
- JSONB reduces table proliferation
- Ready for horizontal partitioning by date
