# Care Plans & Tasks Library - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Care Plans & Tasks Library vertical has been successfully implemented, providing comprehensive functionality for managing structured care plans, goals, interventions, and daily task execution. This vertical is core to the Care Commons platform, bridging the gap between high-level care coordination and day-to-day service delivery.

## What Was Built

### Core Components

1. **Type System** (`src/types/care-plan.ts`)
   - 35+ TypeScript interfaces and types
   - Complete domain model for care plans, goals, interventions, tasks
   - Support for progress tracking, signatures, verification
   - Comprehensive enums for categories, statuses, frequencies

2. **Validation Layer** (`src/validation/care-plan-validator.ts`)
   - Zod schemas for runtime type validation
   - Input validation for all API operations
   - Business rule validation (activation, completion, etc.)
   - Vital signs range checking
   - Custom validation helpers

3. **Repository Layer** (`src/repository/care-plan-repository.ts`)
   - CarePlanRepository with full CRUD operations
   - Advanced search and filtering
   - Task instance management
   - Progress note operations
   - Optimized queries with proper indexing

4. **Service Layer** (`src/service/care-plan-service.ts`)
   - CarePlanService with business logic
   - Permission-based access control
   - Care plan lifecycle management (create → activate → review → expire)
   - Task generation from templates
   - Task completion workflow
   - Progress note creation
   - Analytics and metrics

### Data Model

#### Three Main Tables

1. **care_plans** - Comprehensive care plan records
   - Identity and associations (client, organization, branch)
   - Plan metadata (type, status, priority, dates)
   - Care team assignments
   - JSONB columns for goals, interventions, task templates
   - Authorization tracking
   - Compliance status
   - Complete audit trail

2. **task_instances** - Individual tasks to be performed
   - References to care plan, visit, client, caregiver
   - Task details (name, description, category, instructions)
   - Scheduling information
   - Completion data (notes, signatures, verification)
   - Quality check responses
   - Issue reporting

3. **progress_notes** - Narrative and structured documentation
   - Author information
   - Note type (visit, summary, review, incident)
   - Content with full-text search
   - Structured goal progress
   - Observations by category
   - Concerns and recommendations
   - Review and approval workflow

### Key Features

- Issue reporting trends

### Validation & Business Rules

1. **Care Plan Activation**
   - Must have at least one goal
   - Must have at least one intervention
   - Must have assigned coordinator
   - Effective date cannot be in future
   - Expiration date must be after effective date

2. **Task Completion**
   - Signature required if flagged
   - Note required if flagged
   - Vital signs validated for reasonable ranges
   - Custom fields must be populated if required
   - Status transitions validated

3. **Data Validation**
   - String length limits
   - Date range validation
   - Numeric ranges (percentages, vital signs)
   - Required field enforcement
   - Enum value validation

### Database Schema

#### Optimizations
- Comprehensive indexing strategy
- GIN indexes for JSONB columns
- Full-text search indexes
- Composite indexes for common queries
- Partial indexes for filtered queries
- Foreign key constraints
- Update triggers for timestamps

#### Performance Considerations
- JSONB for flexible nested data
- Efficient pagination support
- Query optimization patterns
- Connection pooling ready
- Suitable for read replicas

### API Design

Clean, RESTful API structure:
- Standard CRUD operations
- Search and filter endpoints
- Workflow-specific endpoints (activate, complete, skip)
- Analytics endpoints
- Consistent error handling
- Permission enforcement

### Security & Compliance

1. **Access Control**
   - Permission-based operations
   - Organization boundary enforcement
   - Role-based access patterns
   - Field-level permissions (sensitive data)

2. **Audit Trail**
   - Created/updated by tracking
   - Version numbers for optimistic locking
   - Soft delete support
   - Modification history in JSONB

3. **Data Protection**
   - Signature data encryption (placeholder)
   - PHI handling considerations
   - Secure photo storage patterns
   - Audit log retention

## Integration Points

### Dependencies
- **@care-commons/core** - Base types, database, permissions
- **Client & Demographics** - Client records
- **Caregiver & Staff Management** - Caregiver assignment
- **Scheduling & Visit Management** - Visit association

### Future Integrations

- Billing & Invoicing (authorized services)
- Mobile App (field staff interface)
- Family Portal (progress visibility)
- Document Management (attachments)
