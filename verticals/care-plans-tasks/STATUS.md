## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Minor Fixes Needed)

**NOTE**: The compilation errors listed below may have already been fixed. Verify current build status with:
```bash
npm run build
npm run typecheck
```

If the build succeeds, these issues have been resolved and this section can be removed.

### Compilation Errors (IF STILL PRESENT)

The vertical has several minor TypeScript errors that need to be fixed:

1. **Repository Base Class** - Should use `this.database` instead of `this.db`
   - File: `src/repository/care-plan-repository.ts`
   - Fix: Change all `this.db` to `this.database`

2. **Entity Type Issues** - CarePlan, TaskInstance, ProgressNote don't have `id` property directly
   - File: `src/repository/care-plan-repository.ts`
   - Fix: The types actually do have `id` from Entity interface, but TypeScript isn't picking it up
   - Solution: Add explicit type assertions or restructure return objects

3. **Observation Timestamp** - Missing from CreateProgressNoteInput
   - File: `src/service/care-plan-service.ts`
   - Fix: Add timestamp when creating observations

4. **Spread Issues** - Some type spreading issues with signatures and verification data
   - File: `src/service/care-plan-service.ts`
   - Fix: Use proper type assertions

5. **Import Errors** - Node modules not yet installed
   - Run: `npm install` from project root to install workspace dependencies

## üîß Quick Fixes Required

### 1. Fix Repository Database Property

```typescript
// In care-plan-repository.ts, change:
this.db.query(...)

// To:
this.database.query(...)
```

### 2. Fix Observation Timestamp

```typescript
// In care-plan-service.ts, createProgressNote method, add timestamp:
observations: validatedInput.observations?.map(obs => ({
  ...obs,
  timestamp: new Date(),
})),
```

### 3. Fix Signature Spreading

```typescript
// In completeTask method, fix signature spreading:
completionSignature: validatedInput.signature ? {
  ...validatedInput.signature,
  signedAt: new Date(),
  signedBy: context.userId, // Add missing field
} : undefined,
```

### 4. Fix Verification Data

```typescript
// In completeTask method, fix verification spreading:
verificationData: validatedInput.verificationData ? {
  verificationType: validatedInput.verificationData.verificationType,
  ...validatedInput.verificationData,
  verifiedAt: new Date(),
  verifiedBy: context.userId,
} : undefined,
```

## üöÄ Next Steps (In Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Fix Compilation Errors ‚úÖ COMPLETE
~~All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved.~~

### Phase 2: Database Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETE
~~Database migration `20251030214716_care_plans_tables.ts` has been created and applied successfully. This comprehensive migration includes:~~
- ~~care_plans table with full schema~~
- ~~task_instances table with verification support~~
- ~~progress_notes table with structured observations~~
- ~~All indexes (including GIN indexes for JSONB columns)~~
- ~~All triggers for updated_at timestamps~~
- ~~All constraints and foreign keys~~
~~All 12 migrations have been applied to the database.~~

### Phase 3: Seed Data ‚úÖ COMPLETE
~~Seed data script exists and creates realistic demo data:~~
- ~~Two complete care plans (Margaret Thompson, Robert Martinez)~~
- ~~Multiple task instances showing various states~~
- ~~Detailed progress notes with structured observations~~
~~Run with: `npm run db:seed:care-plans`~~

### Phase 4: API Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETE
~~All Express routes have been implemented in `src/api/care-plan-handlers.ts` and integrated in `packages/app/src/routes/index.ts`:~~
- ~~20+ REST endpoints for care plans, tasks, and progress notes~~
- ~~Request/response validation using Zod schemas~~
- ~~Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes~~
- ~~Permission checks on all endpoints~~
~~The API is demo-ready and can be tested using the curl examples in DEMO.md~~

### Phase 5: Testing (IN PROGRESS)
1. [ ] Write unit tests for validators
2. [ ] Write unit tests for service methods
3. [ ] Write integration tests for repository
4. [ ] End-to-end API tests
5. [ ] Load testing for analytics

### Phase 6: Frontend Implementation (TODO)
1. [ ] Create React components for care plan management
2. [ ] Build task completion UI with signature capture
3. [ ] Implement progress note forms

2. [ ] File upload for photos (S3/cloud storage)
3. [ ] Notifications (email/SMS for task reminders and expiration alerts)
4. [ ] Real-time updates via WebSockets
5. [ ] Advanced reporting and data export

## üí° Design Decisions

### Why JSONB for Nested Data?
- Flexibility for varying goal/intervention structures
- Faster than JOIN queries for nested data
- PostgreSQL GIN indexes provide good query performance
- Easier to evolve schema over time
- Matches the document-oriented nature of care plans

### Why Separate Task Instances?
- Enables tracking of individual task execution
- Supports offline data capture and later sync
- Provides granular completion tracking
- Facilitates analytics on task-level data
- Allows for task-specific customization

### Why Structured Observations?
- Enables filtering and searching by category
- Supports severity-based alerting
- Facilitates trend analysis
- Improves reporting capabilities
- Maintains both structure and flexibility

## üîí Security & Compliance

### Implemented
- ‚úÖ Permission-based access control
- ‚úÖ Organization boundary enforcement
- ‚úÖ Audit trail for all operations
- ‚úÖ Soft delete support
- ‚úÖ Version tracking
- ‚úÖ User context in all operations

### Needs Implementation
- ‚è≥ Signature data encryption at rest
- ‚è≥ Photo URL signing
- ‚è≥ PHI field-level encryption
- ‚è≥ HIPAA-compliant logging
- ‚è≥ Data retention policies

## üìà Performance Expectations

Based on the design and PostgreSQL capabilities:

- **Care Plan Creation**: < 100ms
- **Care Plan Retrieval**: < 50ms
- **Task Generation** (10 tasks): < 200ms
- **Task Completion**: < 100ms
- **Progress Note Creation**: < 100ms
- **Search Queries**: < 200ms (with indexes)
- **Analytics**: < 500ms (cacheable)

Scales to:
- 10,000+ care plans per organization
- 100,000+ task instances per month
- 50,000+ progress notes per month
- 100+ concurrent users

## ü§ù Integration Readiness

### Ready to Integrate With:
- ‚úÖ Client & Demographics (client records)
