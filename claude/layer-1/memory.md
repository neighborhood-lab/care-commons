# Care Commons - Central Planner Vision & State
*Last Updated: 2025-11-06*

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Care Commons** is a self-hostable, modular home healthcare platform serving agencies managing in-home care. Our mission is to provide agencies with production-ready tools that handle compliance, scheduling, billing, and family engagement while remaining lean, maintainable, and scalable.

**Current State**: Strong backend foundations (80-90% complete), partial frontend implementation, mobile foundation established. **Next Phase**: Complete service integrations, implement remaining frontend verticals, expand mobile app, and ensure production readiness.

---

## PRODUCT VISION

### Core Value Proposition
A **turnkey home healthcare platform** that agencies can self-host or deploy via Vercel in minutes, providing:
- ✅ Multi-state EVV compliance (TX, FL, OH, PA, GA, NC, AZ)
- ✅ Intelligent scheduling and shift matching
- ✅ Family engagement and transparency
- ✅ Complete billing and payroll workflows
- ✅ Offline-first mobile experience for caregivers
- ✅ Real-time analytics and compliance reporting

### Target Personas

1. **Administrators**: Need overview of operations, financial health, compliance status
2. **Coordinators**: Manage day-to-day scheduling, caregiver assignments, client needs
3. **Caregivers**: Complete visits, document care, track time via mobile app
4. **Family Members**: Monitor loved one's care, communicate with care team
5. **Clients/Patients**: Receive quality care with transparency

### Product Principles

1. **Real-World First**: Features must work end-to-end in production, not just demos
2. **Offline-First**: Mobile and web must work without connectivity, sync when online
3. **Compliance-Native**: EVV, HIPAA, state-specific rules baked into every feature
4. **Learnable by Discovery**: Showcase and demo environment teach users the platform
5. **Less is More**: Remove cruft aggressively, prefer 1 great way over 3 mediocre ways
6. **Developer Speed**: Tooling, architecture, and documentation optimize for rapid iteration

---

## ARCHITECTURE VISION

### Technology Philosophy

**Backend**: Node.js/TypeScript with Express, PostgreSQL with Knex migrations, JWT auth
**Frontend Web**: React 19 + Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand + React Query
**Frontend Mobile**: React Native + Expo, WatermelonDB (offline-first)
**Deployment**: Vercel serverless (default), self-hosted Docker (supported)

**Architectural Patterns**:
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo with package isolation and shared components
- **Vertical Slice**: Each vertical (billing, scheduling, etc.) is independently deployable
- **Event-Driven**: Visit lifecycle events trigger dependent systems
- **Provider Interfaces**: Service contracts enable mocking and testing

---

## CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

### What Works Well ✅

1. **Database Schema**: Comprehensive, normalized, with audit trails and soft deletes
2. **Authentication**: JWT + refresh tokens, Google OAuth, password fallback
3. **EVV Compliance**: 7-state support with GPS, biometric, offline sync
4. **Shift Matching**: 8-dimensional scoring algorithm (production-ready)
5. **Billing**: Service-to-billable conversion, invoicing, rate schedules
6. **Offline Architecture**: WatermelonDB with sync protocol
7. **Documentation**: Extensive (50+ docs covering deployment, compliance, architecture)
8. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for test, build, deploy
9. **Monorepo Setup**: Turborepo with proper dependency management

### Critical Gaps 🚧

**MAJOR UPDATE (2025-11-08)**: Previous documentation was outdated. Actual codebase inspection reveals platform is 85-90% production-ready.

**✅ RESOLVED (Previously Listed as Blockers)**:
1. ~~**Mocked Service Integrations**~~ - **FIXED**
   - EVV service now uses real provider interfaces (lines 87-93 of `verticals/time-tracking-evv/src/service/evv-service.ts`)
   - Provider interfaces fully wired across verticals
   - Scheduling service only has minor holiday calendar TODO (non-blocking)

2. ~~**Care Plans Frontend**~~ - **COMPLETE**
   - 17 components + 7 pages implemented at `packages/web/src/verticals/care-plans/`
   - Task management, templates, progress tracking all functional

3. ~~**Family Engagement Frontend**~~ - **COMPLETE**
   - Implemented November 2024 (commits: 254eae4, 9fdecb4, 4e8d176)
   - Full dashboard, messaging, notifications at `packages/web/src/verticals/family-engagement/`
   - Role-based routing working in production

**🚧 REMAINING GAPS (Medium Priority)**:

**Frontend Web**:
1. **Payroll Processing UI**: Backend 100% complete (58K line migration), frontend 70% complete
   - Pay stub generation UI needed
   - Tax calculation display needed
   - Estimated: 1 week

2. **Analytics Dashboard**: Backend complete, frontend 70% complete
   - Admin dashboard needs completion
   - Export functionality needed (PDF, Excel, CSV)
   - Estimated: 1 week

3. **Quality Assurance Module**: Schema ready, implementation 40% complete
   - Audit workflows needed
   - QA dashboard needed
   - Estimated: 2 weeks

**Frontend Mobile**:
1. **Screen Implementations**: Foundation 100% complete, 4/6 screens need implementation
   - ✅ LoginScreen (complete with biometric auth)
   - ✅ TodayVisitsScreen (complete reference implementation)
   - 🚧 ClockInScreen (GPS verification UI needed)
   - 🚧 TasksScreen (task completion UI needed)
   - 🚧 ScheduleScreen (visit list UI needed)
   - 🚧 ProfileScreen (settings UI needed)
   - Estimated: 2-3 days per screen

**DevEx & Testing**:
1. **E2E Test Coverage**: Minimal coverage for critical workflows
   - Visit lifecycle (schedule → clock-in → complete → bill)
   - Family portal workflows
   - Multi-persona scenarios
   - Estimated: 1 week

2. **Load Testing**: Not yet performed
   - Need baseline performance metrics
   - Need 50+ concurrent user testing
   - Need optimization targets
   - Estimated: 3-5 days

3. **API Documentation**: Incomplete for some verticals (needs OpenAPI/Swagger)

---

## DECISION LOG

### Technology Choices

1. **Why Turborepo over Nx?** → Simpler, faster, less configuration
2. **Why Knex over Prisma?** → More control over migrations, better for complex queries
3. **Why WatermelonDB?** → Best offline-first solution for React Native with mature sync
4. **Why Vercel over AWS?** → Simpler deployment, better DX, adequate for target scale
5. **Why Zustand over Redux?** → Less boilerplate, easier to learn, sufficient for needs

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Monorepo over Polyrepo** → Easier to refactor across packages, shared tooling
2. **Vertical Slice over Layered** → Faster feature development, clearer ownership
3. **Provider Interfaces** → Enable testing without database, enable multiple implementations
4. **Offline-First** → Critical for caregivers in homes without WiFi
5. **JWT over Sessions** → Stateless, works with serverless, scales horizontally

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

1. ❌ **Feature Bloat**: Don't add features without clear persona need
2. ❌ **Premature Optimization**: Profile before optimizing
3. ❌ **Over-Abstraction**: Prefer duplication over wrong abstraction
4. ❌ **Test Theater**: Tests that don't catch real bugs waste time
5. ❌ **Documentation Debt**: Undocumented code is technical debt
6. ❌ **Magic Numbers**: Always use named constants
7. ❌ **Anemic Models**: Business logic should be in service layer, not controllers
