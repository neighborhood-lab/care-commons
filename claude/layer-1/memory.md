# Care Commons - Central Planner Vision & State
*Last Updated: 2025-11-06*

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Care Commons** is a self-hostable, modular home healthcare platform serving agencies managing in-home care. Our mission is to provide agencies with production-ready tools that handle compliance, scheduling, billing, and family engagement while remaining lean, maintainable, and scalable.

**Current State**: Strong backend foundations (80-90% complete), partial frontend implementation, mobile foundation established. **Next Phase**: Complete service integrations, implement remaining frontend verticals, expand mobile app, and ensure production readiness.

---

## PRODUCT VISION

### Core Value Proposition
A **turnkey home healthcare platform** that agencies can self-host or deploy via Vercel in minutes, providing:
- ✅ Multi-state EVV compliance (TX, FL, OH, PA, GA, NC, AZ)
- ✅ Intelligent scheduling and shift matching
- ✅ Family engagement and transparency
- ✅ Complete billing and payroll workflows
- ✅ Offline-first mobile experience for caregivers
- ✅ Real-time analytics and compliance reporting

### Target Personas

1. **Administrators**: Need overview of operations, financial health, compliance status
2. **Coordinators**: Manage day-to-day scheduling, caregiver assignments, client needs
3. **Caregivers**: Complete visits, document care, track time via mobile app
4. **Family Members**: Monitor loved one's care, communicate with care team
5. **Clients/Patients**: Receive quality care with transparency

### Product Principles

1. **Real-World First**: Features must work end-to-end in production, not just demos
2. **Offline-First**: Mobile and web must work without connectivity, sync when online
3. **Compliance-Native**: EVV, HIPAA, state-specific rules baked into every feature
4. **Learnable by Discovery**: Showcase and demo environment teach users the platform
5. **Less is More**: Remove cruft aggressively, prefer 1 great way over 3 mediocre ways
6. **Developer Speed**: Tooling, architecture, and documentation optimize for rapid iteration

---

## ARCHITECTURE VISION

### Technology Philosophy

**Backend**: Node.js/TypeScript with Express, PostgreSQL with Knex migrations, JWT auth
**Frontend Web**: React 19 + Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand + React Query
**Frontend Mobile**: React Native + Expo, WatermelonDB (offline-first)
**Deployment**: Vercel serverless (default), self-hosted Docker (supported)

**Architectural Patterns**:
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo with package isolation and shared components
- **Vertical Slice**: Each vertical (billing, scheduling, etc.) is independently deployable
- **Event-Driven**: Visit lifecycle events trigger dependent systems
- **Provider Interfaces**: Service contracts enable mocking and testing

**Design System Goals**:
- Consistent Tailwind tokens across web and mobile
- Reusable form patterns (React Hook Form + Zod everywhere)
- Accessible components (WCAG AA minimum)
- Mobile-first responsive design

---

## CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

### What Works Well ✅

1. **Database Schema**: Comprehensive, normalized, with audit trails and soft deletes
2. **Authentication**: JWT + refresh tokens, Google OAuth, password fallback
3. **EVV Compliance**: 7-state support with GPS, biometric, offline sync
4. **Shift Matching**: 8-dimensional scoring algorithm (production-ready)
5. **Billing**: Service-to-billable conversion, invoicing, rate schedules
6. **Offline Architecture**: WatermelonDB with sync protocol
7. **Documentation**: Extensive (50+ docs covering deployment, compliance, architecture)
8. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for test, build, deploy
9. **Monorepo Setup**: Turborepo with proper dependency management

### Critical Gaps 🚧

**Backend**:
1. **Mocked Service Integrations**: EVV and Scheduling services have placeholder data instead of real lookups
   - `packages/app/src/services/evv-service.ts` lines 60-92 (mocked client/caregiver data)
   - `verticals/scheduling-visits/src/services/schedule.service.ts` line 566-576 (placeholder addresses)
   - **Impact**: Features appear complete but won't work in production

2. **Provider Interface Implementation**: Contracts defined (`IVisitProvider`, `IClientProvider`, `ICaregiverProvider`) but not fully wired up across verticals

**Frontend Web**:
1. **Care Plans & Tasks**: Backend API complete, frontend UI needed
2. **Family Engagement**: Portal and messaging UI not implemented
3. **Payroll Processing**: UI for pay stubs, tax calculations needed
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Partial implementation, needs completion

**Frontend Mobile**:
1. **Screen Implementations**: Foundation exists, but most screens are placeholders
   - `TodayVisitsScreen` is fully implemented (reference example)
   - Other screens need build-out following the same pattern

**DevEx & Speed**:
1. **Test Coverage**: Below 70% target in some packages
2. **API Documentation**: Incomplete for some verticals (needs OpenAPI/Swagger)
3. **Mobile Development**: Manual testing only, needs automation

---

## DECISION LOG

### Technology Choices

1. **Why Turborepo over Nx?** → Simpler, faster, less configuration
2. **Why Knex over Prisma?** → More control over migrations, better for complex queries
3. **Why WatermelonDB?** → Best offline-first solution for React Native with mature sync
4. **Why Vercel over AWS?** → Simpler deployment, better DX, adequate for target scale
5. **Why Zustand over Redux?** → Less boilerplate, easier to learn, sufficient for needs

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Monorepo over Polyrepo** → Easier to refactor across packages, shared tooling
2. **Vertical Slice over Layered** → Faster feature development, clearer ownership
3. **Provider Interfaces** → Enable testing without database, enable multiple implementations
4. **Offline-First** → Critical for caregivers in homes without WiFi
5. **JWT over Sessions** → Stateless, works with serverless, scales horizontally

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

1. ❌ **Feature Bloat**: Don't add features without clear persona need
2. ❌ **Premature Optimization**: Profile before optimizing
3. ❌ **Over-Abstraction**: Prefer duplication over wrong abstraction
4. ❌ **Test Theater**: Tests that don't catch real bugs waste time
5. ❌ **Documentation Debt**: Undocumented code is technical debt
6. ❌ **Magic Numbers**: Always use named constants
7. ❌ **Anemic Models**: Business logic should be in service layer, not controllers
