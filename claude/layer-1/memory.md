# Care Commons - Central Planner Vision & State
*Last Updated: 2025-11-08*

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Care Commons** is a self-hostable, modular home healthcare platform serving agencies managing in-home care. Our mission is to provide agencies with production-ready tools that handle compliance, scheduling, billing, and family engagement while remaining lean, maintainable, and scalable.

**Current State**: Strong backend foundations (80-90% complete), partial frontend implementation, mobile foundation established. **Next Phase**: Complete service integrations, implement remaining frontend verticals, expand mobile app, and ensure production readiness.

---

## PRODUCT VISION

### Core Value Proposition
A **turnkey home healthcare platform** that agencies can self-host or deploy via Vercel in minutes, providing:
- ✅ Multi-state EVV compliance (TX, FL, OH, PA, GA, NC, AZ)
- ✅ Intelligent scheduling and shift matching
- ✅ Family engagement and transparency
- ✅ Complete billing and payroll workflows
- ✅ Offline-first mobile experience for caregivers
- ✅ Real-time analytics and compliance reporting

### Target Personas

1. **Administrators**: Need overview of operations, financial health, compliance status
2. **Coordinators**: Manage day-to-day scheduling, caregiver assignments, client needs
3. **Caregivers**: Complete visits, document care, track time via mobile app
4. **Family Members**: Monitor loved one's care, communicate with care team
5. **Clients/Patients**: Receive quality care with transparency

### Product Principles

1. **Real-World First**: Features must work end-to-end in production, not just demos
2. **Offline-First**: Mobile and web must work without connectivity, sync when online
3. **Compliance-Native**: EVV, HIPAA, state-specific rules baked into every feature
4. **Learnable by Discovery**: Showcase and demo environment teach users the platform
5. **Less is More**: Remove cruft aggressively, prefer 1 great way over 3 mediocre ways
6. **Developer Speed**: Tooling, architecture, and documentation optimize for rapid iteration

---

## ARCHITECTURE VISION

### Technology Philosophy

**Backend**: Node.js/TypeScript with Express, PostgreSQL with Knex migrations, JWT auth
**Frontend Web**: React 19 + Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand + React Query
**Frontend Mobile**: React Native + Expo, WatermelonDB (offline-first)
**Deployment**: Vercel serverless (default), self-hosted Docker (supported)

**Architectural Patterns**:
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo with package isolation and shared components
- **Vertical Slice**: Each vertical (billing, scheduling, etc.) is independently deployable
- **Event-Driven**: Visit lifecycle events trigger dependent systems
- **Provider Interfaces**: Service contracts enable mocking and testing
