## Status

[x] In Progress
[ ] Completed

## Priority

## Description

The comprehensive showcase seed script (`seed-showcase-comprehensive.ts`) generates 900+ demo records but lacks user documentation. Add README documentation explaining how to use the script, what data it generates, and how to customize it for different scenarios.

- [ ] Document npm commands for seeding
- [ ] Explain what data is generated
- [ ] Document how to clean up demo data
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section
- [ ] Document environment variables required

## Technical Notes

- Script is at `packages/core/scripts/seed-showcase-comprehensive.ts`

- All data tagged with `is_demo_data = true`
- Requires org, branch, and admin user to exist first
