**CLAUDE, NEVER EDIT THIS FILE**

Pick up one task defined in a `claude/layer-2/input/NNNN-*.md` file where the `NNNN` is the lowest value in the directory that conforms to the instructions in your prompt.

- If you do not finish the task completely then leave that file in place.
- If you do complete the task then delete the file from the repository.

**IMPORTANT!!! EITHER WAY, YOU MUST ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES IN THE SOURCE CODE IN THE FEATURE BRANCH YOU CREATE AND COMMIT THEM TO THAT FEATURE BRANCH AND PUSH TO GITHUB. SOMEONE ELSE WITH CREATE THE PULL REQUEST. DO NOT SIMPLY DELETE THE TASK FILE.**

**IMPORTANT!!! RUN LINT, TYPE CHECK, TEST, and BUILD BEFORE PUSHING TO GITHUB AND CONSIDERING YOUR WORK COMPLETE. WAIT TO SEE THE RESULTS. DO NOT PUSH UNTIL EVERYTHING SUCCEEDS. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF THE ERROR EXISTED BEFORE YOUR WORK. FIX EVERYTHING.**
