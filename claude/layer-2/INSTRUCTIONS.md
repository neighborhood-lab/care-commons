**CLAUDE, NEVER EDIT THIS FILE**

Pick up one task defined in a `claude/layer-2/input/NNNN-*.md` file where the `NNNN` is the lowest value in the directory that conforms to the instructions in your prompt.

- If you do not finish the task completely then leave that file in place.
- If you do complete the task then delete the file from the repository.

**IMPORTANT!!! EITHER WAY, YOU MUST ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES IN THE SOURCE CODE IN THE FEATURE BRANCH YOU CREATE AND COMMIT THEM TO THAT FEATURE BRANCH I PUSH TO GITHUB. SOMEONE ELSE WITH CREATE THE PULL REQUEST. DO NOT SIMPLY DELETE THE TASK FILE.**
