**CLAUDE, NEVER EDIT THIS FILE**

Pick up one task defined in a `claude/layer-2/input/NNNN-*.md` file where the `NNNN` is the lowest value in the directory that conforms to the instructions in your prompt. If you do not finish the task completely then leave that file in place. If you do complete the task then delete the file from the repository.
